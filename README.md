## Description

This page includes a brief intro message welcoming prospective students and thanks them  for considering Epicodus for further education. As they move down the page, they are told about the unique structure of the tracks, and shown what they can apply to. After this, they can review specific languages that are featured as part of the curriculum, and in doing so, grasp which language may be better for them. If they are unable to decide, a survey is given at the bottom, which will help them decide which track may be more fitting for them, based on their skills and what they want to work on. Finally, they will receive a result after they submit their survey, which will show the track that fits them better, and a brief description of what that track can be applied towards, along with a link to learn more.
